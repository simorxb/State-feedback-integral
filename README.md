Is PID control all you know?

That's probably not enough.

State feedback control is a useful alternative.

I have shown the canonical approach in the past (link in the comments).

However the canonical approach has a limitation: it doesn't use integral action, which can cause a steady-state error.

But we can fix that.

Let's see how in a practical example.

A box of mass m = 10 kg, sliding on a surface where it's subject to viscous friction of coefficient k = 0.5 N*s/m, pushed by a force F. It is also subject to an unknown resistance Fd.

The dynamic equation is:

d^2z/dt^2 m = F - k * dz/dt - Fd

We have seen in the past that such a system can be described in a continuous-time state-space model where the two states are z (position) and dz/dt (speed).

Let's choose a control input that includes the integral of the control error:

F = kr*r - k1*z - k2*dz/dt + k3*integral(r - z)

and substitute in the dynamic equation:

d^2z/dt^2 m = kr*r - k1*z - k2*dz/dt + k3*integral(r - z) - k * dz/dt

then move to the Laplace domain:

m*Z(s)*s^2 + (k2 + k)*Z(s)*s + k1*Z(s) + k3*Z(s)/s = kr*R(s) + k3*R(s)/s

and finally the close loop transfer function:

Gc(s) = Z(s)/R(s) = (s*kr/m + k3/m)/[s^3 + s^2*(k2+k)/m + s*k1/m + k3/m]

We now choose a target transfer function with the same form, as follows (time to 90% = ~10s and steady state gain = 1):

T(s) = (0.15*s + 0.064)/(s^3 + 1.2*s^2 + 0.48*s + 0.064)

To have Gc(s) = T(s) we need to choose our control parameters as follows:

âœ… kr/m = 0.15 âž¡ kr = 0.15m = 1.5

âœ… k1/m = 0.48 âž¡ k1 = 0.48m = 4.8

âœ… (k2+k)/m = 1.2 âž¡ k2 = 1.2m - k = 11.5

âœ… k3/m = 0.064 âž¡ k3 = 0.064m = 0.64

The simulation result (from Xcos) of the control algorithm designed above is shown in the picture below, where:

âœ… The control algorithm is implemented in discrete time, with sample time T = 0.1s.

âœ… It is assumed that only the position of the box can be measured, and Gaussian noise has been added to simulate an actual measurement.

âœ… As the speed is not available I used a simple algorithm to calculate the derivative of the position as opposed to an observer, to simplify. The Z-transform of the filtered derivative is D(z) = (z-1)/(z*(T+T_c) - T_c)), where T_c = 0.4.

âœ… The "ideal" response that we expect from T(s) = (0.15*s + 0.064)/(s^3 + 1.2*s^2 + 0.48*s + 0.064) is shown in the plot vs the response of the system.

âœ… Whilst the controller was designed assuming a system with m = 10 kg and k = 0.5 N*s/m, the actual plant used in the simulation has m = 7 kg and k = 0.2 N*s/m. This is to test the robustness to uncertainties on the actual plant.

âœ… The resistance force Fd is 100 N.
